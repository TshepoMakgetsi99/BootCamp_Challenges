    // White a function that takes in three numbers and returns the maximum number. Do this without using any builtin methods. Write your own logic from scratch.

        // Here we say return rather than console.log because we do not just want the value
        // to be displayed we want to store it so that we can use it later.
    // So now when we call this it wonâ€™t display on the console

    function max(number1, number2, number3) {
      
        return Math.max(number1, number2, number3);
       }
    
        console.log(max(2,45,3));
